first_repository

I first created the repository on github then initialized it on git while creating the file "report.md and created the index.html.
I then used my credentials to log in git.
I followed up by adding the 2 files to be tracked.I committed using the special commit message. 
Writing the summary meant I have to stage and commit again so I did.
